An open-source, from-scratch **game engine, built compatible with RenderWare** — the engine behind GTA San
Andreas. Bring your own game files (or a total-conversion mod) and it streams the real world, models and
physics straight into the browser, with no install.

> Unofficial, non-commercial fan project. Not affiliated with Rockstar Games or Take-Two.

## What's inside

A TypeScript / three.js engine for RenderWare assets (DFF/TXD models, COL collision, IMG archives, IPL/IDE
world streaming) with a Rapier-physics player and vehicles — compatible with GTA San Andreas and its mods /
total conversions. See the [architecture overview](./docs/architecture.md) and the per-feature reference in
[docs/features/](./docs/features/).
